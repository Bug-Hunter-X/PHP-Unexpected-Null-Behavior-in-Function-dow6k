This repository contains a PHP file demonstrating unexpected behavior with null values in a function. The function `foo` is designed to add two numbers. However, if either input is null, it returns null. This behavior might be unexpected as in some languages null values might be treated as 0 resulting in the other number as output in the case of one null value. The solution file provides a modified version of the function that handles null values differently.
